### Hi, I am Gabriel and I am here to help you solve your problems with...

- **Data Analysis**  
    What if several assumptions within your business are not true? Believe me, a well-done data analysis will confirm or deny these assumptions and consequently solve several problems within your business.
    
- **Data Analytics**  
    The success of every business is made by the decisions that are taken every day. The preparation of data to "feed" machine learning models will help your business to be prepared for any future decision.
    
- **Data Visualization**  
    All information generated through data needs to be presented in a way that stakeholders are able to directly see what is relevant for them. Whether through charts, reports or dashboards, the art of presenting data can bring immense benefits to everyone connected to your business.

## Who am I?

After years of experience working in the field of business development in companies of different types and sizes, I decided to study economics to specialize in the field of business and finance. At the university, I had contact with subjects where we used data and mathematical models to obtain explanations, predictions and assistance in decision-making in the business environment, such as statistics and econometrics. These subjects were the reason why I started diving into the world of technology in 2018 and combined these two worlds to create my first personal machine learning projects to apply them in the financial market.

Since then, I have been specializing to be a professional increasingly qualified in solving problems using data, and today I am taking an MBA in Data Science and Analytics at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP), the best Brazilian university. With my experience and qualification acquired along the last years, I am able to transform data into value for your business, team and projects!
